## Computer program for Windows that writes text by simulating mouse presses

There is three files:
  1. main.exe - It's the program
  2. texts.txt - Phrases to spam. Program chooses every time random phrase. Every line has one phrase
  3. init.txt - In init.txt you can see some three lines. Every line has a command: <br />
    1. There reads <code>start after 10</code>. It tells to program how many seconds have to wait before starting the program. 
       By default there is number 10, so spammer waits 10 seconds before starting to write. You can change the number. <br />
    2. There is <code>wait 2</code>. It tells how many seconds spammer's  have to wait between writing the phrases. <br />
    3. There is <code>loop FOREVER</code>. It is how many times will program loop, ie how many phrases it will write.
